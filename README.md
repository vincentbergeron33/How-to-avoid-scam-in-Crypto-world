- The performance is the only assessment which has not achieved 100 points. Two main factors explain the lack of performance:

    - The size of the images is the main problem as it takes too long for the images to load. Smaller resolution of images should have been used for the website. This was the main problem of the performance and only that change would have boosted greatly the performance.
