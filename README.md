- The performance is the only assessment which has not achieved 100 points. Two main factors explain the lack of performance:

    - The size of the images is the main problem as it takes too long for the images to load. Smaller resolution of images should have been used for the website. This was the main problem of the performance and only that change would have boosted greatly the performance.
    - The CSS files is too heavy. To achieve a perfect performance, CSS file should have been optimised.

### Unfixed Bugs

 - All bugs have been fixed. Performance could be upgraded by using smaller resolution pictures and by optimizing the CSS file.
