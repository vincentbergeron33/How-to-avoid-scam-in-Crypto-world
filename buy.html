        <h2>Buy using an exchange</h2>
        <hr style="width: 50%; text-align: center; margin-left: 25%;">
        <p>The safest way with the cheapest fees is to buy cryptocurrency through an exchange. Exchanges allow users to make bank 
            transfer which will only cost 1 pound fee for whatever amount you are buying. The challenge is to find the right exchanges. Three criterias are important.
        </p>
        <ul class="list-buy">
            <li>
                <p><u>Overall rating:</u> You need to ensure the exchange is secured. Many exchanges has been hacked in the past year resulting in customers loosing millions of dollars
                    Hacking is a sometime hard to stop. Good exchanges will take the blame and give back those lost to their customers or simply have a good security that will shield their customer.
                    Customer service is also very important, Crypto is a new technology and it is easy to get lost and all the opportunities in front of us. Being able to be guided will
                be a key point in deciding which exchange to choose.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><u>Financial reserve:</u> Since the crash of FTX which brough many other exchanges also to bankrupcy, exchanges started to show their financial reserve to reinsure
                     user that the same problem won't happen to them. Financial reserve is crucial during bear marcket as the volume of transactions goes down as well as the profit of the
                    the exchanges. Bigger the financial reserve, stronger the exchange is to live through the bear marckets. On a little note, the best way to buy your crypto is on exchanges
                 but it doesn't mean it is the best way to store it. The best way to store your crypto in on cold storage like
                  <a href="https://www.ledger.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Visit Ledger to store safely your crypto (opens in a new tab)">Ledger</a>. Not your key, not your money!
                This is a popular saying since the collapse of FTX</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><u>Deposit bonus:</u> All exchanges have high incentive to bring the customer to their platform. Be careful here, this criteria is the least important because loosing all your money
                in a bad exchange like FTX is not worth the crazy bonus they gave you when you signed up. When you choose your exchange, ensure to read the full requirement to get the bonuses.
