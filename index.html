            <h2>What is cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Cryptocurrency is a non-physical currency which is exclusively digital. Instead of being issued by countries, it is issued by its algorithm using participant
                all around the world. This system is a solution to inflation as it cannot create more tokens then the workforce of participant working on the algorihtm. Cryptocurrency
                also use a system called "Blockchain" to undertake any type of transaction which solve the issue of having a middle man like a bank for exemple. The algorihtm complexity
                ensure protecton of all users data.

                <h2>What is a blockchain?</h2>
                <p>Blockchain is used to share information or make transaction with all participant. This means that all participant can see record of the transactions behind undertaken
                    between the participants. It also ensures that no participant can tamper or change a transaction. The transaction is present as a hashtag which is linked to the last transaction
                hastag. Any change of any of those hashtag will reverse to an error, making it impossible for hacker to enter a hashtag block. Transactions are stored in the blockchain meaning that
            the speed of transaction (smart contract) is executed automatically and no delays like we are used to have using bank is required.</p>

                <h2>What is web 3?</h2>
                <p> The main difference between web 2 and web 3 is the decentralization. The web 3 is self-governing and it will distribute, verified or gives permissions to users. The best
                    example is a decentralized exchange like PancakeSwap where you can connet your decentralized wallet and undertake transactions, invest in new technology or stake your token
                    for rewards. Participants that owns the platform token have vote power and votes are being undertaken to upgrade the platform with new features. Small fees from transaction 
                    are used for the developping team to add those features.

                <h2>Token vs Coin</h2>
                <p>A coin is a asset to its own blockchain. Coins are used to transfer money, store of value and use to buy goods and services.
                    Example of coins: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP or Cardano. On the other hand, tokens are created on an existing blockchain. They will be part of the XRP platform
